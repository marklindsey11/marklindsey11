- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @marklindsey11
- I am a mean action stack designer/creator that uses a test-first development model 
focused on creeating purpose-built databases enginered for specific workloads processed
 inside  intigrated business enterprise applications that handle the cluster level
 seperately from the instance level  as current generation optimized instance class R5 4xlarge cluster
 siezing primary database read preferred  and multiple secondary replicas  read/write preferred
 for enhanced read/write velocity  with robust working set memory cache with TLS connection endpoints 
optimized for high throughput  for read-after-write dedicated connection pool and seperate
 secondary consistent (eventually)  connection pool with automatic scaling via Lambda function 
adding read capacity API that start a new replica instance, so the databases are decoupled from
 the compute and storage with a priority to collect, process and analyze real-time streaming data 
with high-performance caching for high-volume workloads, and running inference workloads in-memory 
with pretrained dynamic cloud-native DB running analytics .
  The data is the primary mission critical element in virtually every OS, discovering exactly which 
applications are running specific workloads and determine the type of DB that is required to store specific
Types of data is expected. So that's  my readme, i tend to ramble on.
     I design and develop non-schema, non-relational NoSQL databases that are purpose built an    
customized to individual application processes with point-to-point dedicated high performance data 
connection pools with replicas populating Content Delivery Networks (CDN). So my first step is defining
what applications the EvE operating enviroment is running, what the processes are, what data type,
expected volume of data and other specifics I need to build the data model that will provide the power
to perform compute operations.
