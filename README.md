I'm the director of the Cyber Warfare Center Pacific (CYWAR-CENPAC) Joint Mission Analysis Center (JMAC) at Liberty Station ex-USNTC Point Loma in San Diego County California USA. I specialize in transitioning cryptographically-vulnerable AES and BGP cryptosystems to Quantum-resistant cryptosystems using the Python implementation of the algabraic lattice-based LWE variant \emph{ring-LWE} in CRYSTALS Kyber v 3.02 cryptographic suite IND-CCA2 secure key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) solving the LWE problem. The next frontier.
